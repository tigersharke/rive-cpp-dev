C++ runtime for Rive. Provides these runtime features:

* Loading Artboards and their contents from .riv files.
* Querying LinearAnimations and StateMachines from Artboards.
* Making changes to Artboard hierarchy (fundamentally same guts used by
  LinearAnimations and StateMachines) and effienclty solving those changes via
  Artboard::advance.
* Abstract Renderer for submitting high level vector path commands with retained
  path objects to optimize and minimize path re-computation (ultimately up to
  the concrete rendering implementation).
* Example concrete renderer written in C++ with Skia. Skia renderer code is in
  skia/renderer/src/skia_renderer.cpp.
